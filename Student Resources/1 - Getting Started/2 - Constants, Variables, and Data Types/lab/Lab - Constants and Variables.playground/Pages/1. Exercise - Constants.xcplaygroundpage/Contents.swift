/*:
 ## Exercise - Constants

 Declare a constant called `friends` to represent the number of friends you have on social media. Give it a value between 50 and 1000. Print out the value by referencing your constant.
 */
let friends = 75

/*:
 Now assume you go through and remove a lot of your friends that aren't active on social media. Update your `friends` constant to a lower number than it currently is between 1 and 900.
 */
//friends = 50

/*:
 Does the above code compile? Why not? Print your explanation to the console using the `print` function. Go back and delete your line of code that updates the `friends` constant to a lower number so that the playground will compile properly.
 */
print("You can not change a value of a constant, switch to var to make it mutable")
