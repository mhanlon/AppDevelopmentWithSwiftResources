# App Development with Swift Resources

This repo contains the Swift Playground labs from Apple's [App Development with Swift](https://books.apple.com/us/book/app-development-with-swift/id1465002990) curriculum (the Xcode 10 edition).

You can download these resources and the project files for the other chapters from Apple here: [https://education-static.apple.com/app-dev-swift/v2.7/resources/student.zip](https://education-static.apple.com/app-dev-swift/v2.7/resources/student.zip)

This repo is intended as an aide to the online App Development with Swift courses you'll be attending, as a way of helping you go through the material before our final catch-up.
